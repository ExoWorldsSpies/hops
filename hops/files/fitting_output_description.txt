--- results.txt ---
Contains the fitting results, where N0, L0, Q0 are the 0th, 1st and 2nd order systematics,
fitted on the light curve at the same time as the transit, ldc1, ldc2, ldc3, ldc4 are the limb darkening
coefficients calculated for the specific filter and stellar properties given during the fitting process,
rp is the planet to star radius ratio (no units), a is the semi-major axis relatively to the stellar radius
(no units), e is the eccentricity (no units), i is the inclination (degrees), w is the argument of periastron
(degrees) and mt is the mid-transit time (BJD_TDB).

--- set_1_model.txt ---
Contains the data and the final model. The columns contain the following information (in order):
1. mid-exposure time in BJD_TDB
2. orbital phase
3. relative flux
4. uncertainty on the relative flux used during fitting
5. model
6. fitting residuals

--- set_1_detrended_model.txt ---
Contains the detrended data and the final model, where all fluxes have been divided by the best-fit model for
the systematics. The columns contain the following information (in order):
1. mid-exposure time in BJD_TDB
2. orbital phase
3. detrended relative flux
4. detrended uncertainty on the relative flux used during fitting
5. detrended model
6. detrended fitting residuals

Shows the correlation between the fitted parameters during the MCMC process. A good fitting is indicated by
well-shaped normal distributions in all the plots across the diagonal.

--- detrended_model.pdf ---
Shows the final transit model, data and residuals (data-model), divided by the best fit model for the systematics
(a second-order polynomial is fitted simultaneously with the transit model).
