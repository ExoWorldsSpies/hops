Filter                      Filter used for the observation
Epoch                       Epoch of the transit, based on the provided ephemeris.
Number of outliers removed  Number of outlying points detected and removed.
Uncertainties scale factor  Originally the uncertainties are SQRT(FLUX + 2*SKY)
                            however these may be underestimated or overestimated due to
                            the gain of the camera. During the fitting, the uncertainties
                            are scaled based on the RMS of the residuals of the best-fit model.

Residuals / Detrended Residuals:
Mean                        Mean value of the residuals
STD                         Standard deviation of the residuals
RMS                         Root mean square of the residuals
Chi squared                 Chi squared of the residuals
Reduced chi squared         Reduced chi squared of the residuals
Max auto-correlation        Maximum value of the autocorrelation function of the normalised residuals
Max auto-correlation flag   Flag indicating weather the maximum value of the autocorrelation function is higher than what is expected from a gaussian distribution
Shapiro test                1 - shapiro statistic on the residuals
Shapiro test flag           Flag indicating weather the shapiro test is higher than what is expected from a gaussian distribution

Shows the correlation between the fitted parameters during the MCMC process. A good fitting is indicated by
well-shaped normal distributions in all the plots across the diagonal.

--- detrended_model.pdf ---
Shows the final transit model, data and residuals (data-model), divided by the best fit model for the systematics
(a second-order polynomial is fitted simultaneously with the transit model).
