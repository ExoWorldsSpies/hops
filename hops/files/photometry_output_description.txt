--- FOV.pdf ---
Shows the field of view and the selected targets and comparison stars

--- RESULTS.pdf ---
Shows the relative light curves for the target and the comparison stars.

--- ExoClock_info.txt ---
Contains the information that you will need to uplod to ExoClock, if you are observing an exoplanet and you wish to
contribute to the ExoClock project (https://www.exoclock.space). See inside the file for more information.

--- PHOTOMETRY_APERTURE.txt ---
Contains the relative light curve of the target as calculated by the aperture photometry method. The columns contain
the following information (in order):
1. exposure start time in JD_UTC
2. relative flux (flux of the target divided by the sum of all the comparison stars)
3. relative flux uncertainty

CAUTION!!!!!!!
The uncertainties reported do not take into account the gain and the read-noise of the camera.
If the read-noise of your camera is much lower than the flux of the stars studied, the true
uncertainties can be approximated by dividing the reported uncertainties with the square root of the camera's gain.

--- PHOTOMETRY_GAUSS.txt ---
Contains the relative light curve of the target as calculated by the PSF fitting photometry method. The columns contain
the following information (in order):
1. exposure start time in JD_UTC
2. relative flux (flux of the target divided by the sum of all the comparison stars)
3. relative flux uncertainty

CAUTION!!!!!!!
The uncertainties reported do not take into account the gain and the read-noise of the camera.
If the read-noise of your camera is much lower than the flux of the stars studied, the true
uncertainties can be approximated by dividing the reported uncertainties with the square root of the camera's gain.
